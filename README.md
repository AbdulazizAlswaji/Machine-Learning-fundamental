# Machine-Learning-with-Python-A-Practical-Introduction

This course dives into the basics of Machine Learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python.  We will be reviewing two main components:

* the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
* a general overview of Machine Learning topics, such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms.
